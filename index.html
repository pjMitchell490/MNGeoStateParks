    <h2>Telling the Story of the Geology of Minnesota's State Parks</h2>
    <p>
        As a member of the Park Utility Mapping Project, I have the wonderful opportunity of travelling throughout the state of Minnesota to visit its beautiful parks.
        I'm building this webpage to tell the story of our state's geologic history.
